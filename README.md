***Customer Segmentation Using KMeans Clustering***

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using KMeans clustering on e-commerce transactional data. The segmentation is based on both customer demographic features and transactional behavior, such as coupon usage frequency, claimed ratio, and burnt ratio. This segmentation helps in identifying distinct customer groups, which can be targeted for marketing strategies like coupon distribution to enhance customer loyalty.

**Project Overview**

The main goal of this project is to:

Segment customers based on demographic and transactional data.
Use unsupervised learning techniques, specifically KMeans, to group similar customers.
Analyze customer behavior in each segment and provide actionable insights for coupon distribution and marketing strategies.
Dataset Description
The dataset consists of six tables:

**Customers Table:**

**customer_id:** Unique identifier for each customer.

**join_date:** The date the customer joined.

**city_id:** The ID representing the customer's city.

**gender_id:** The ID representing the customer's gender.

**Genders Table:**

**gender_id:** Unique identifier for each gender.

**gender_name:** Name of the gender (e.g., male, female).

**Cities Table:**

**city_id:** Unique identifier for each city.

**city_name:** Name of the city.

**Transactions Table:**

**transaction_id:** Unique identifier for each coupon transaction.

**customer_id:** ID of the customer who performed the transaction.

**transaction_date:** The date the coupon was claimed.

**transaction_status:** Status of the coupon (e.g., claimed, burnt).

**coupon_name:** The name of the coupon.

**burn_date:** The date the coupon was burnt.

**branch_id:** ID of the branch where the coupon was burnt.

**Branches Table:**

**branch_id:** Unique identifier for each branch.

**merchant_id:** ID of the merchant who owns the branch.

**Merchants Table:**

**merchant_id:** Unique identifier for each merchant.

**merchant_name:** Name of the merchant.

***Project Workflow***

**Data Loading:**

Data is loaded from CSV files (or Excel sheets), representing customers, transactions, cities, genders, branches, and merchants.

**Data Merging:**

Customer data is merged with city and gender information.
Transaction data is merged with customer data to link customer behavior to transactional activity.
Branches are linked with merchants.

**Feature Engineering:**

Key features such as coupon usage frequency (transaction count), claimed ratio, and burnt ratio are calculated from the transaction data.
Categorical features like gender and city are encoded using LabelEncoder.

**Feature Selection:**

**The selected features for segmentation are:**

gender_encoded
city_encoded
transaction_count (coupon usage frequency)
claimed_ratio (ratio of transactions where the coupon was claimed)
burnt_ratio (ratio of transactions where the coupon was burnt)

**Clustering:**

KMeans Clustering is applied to the selected features.
The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method.
Clustering performance is evaluated using the Silhouette Score.

**Cluster Analysis:**

The resulting clusters are analyzed and visualized based on customer behavior (e.g., coupon usage frequency, claimed ratio).
Insights are provided for each cluster, indicating which customer segments should receive coupons or special offers to maximize engagement and loyalty.
Key Python Libraries Used
**pandas:** For data manipulation and merging.

**numpy:** For numerical operations.

**sklearn:** For clustering (KMeans), label encoding, scaling, and evaluation metrics.

**matplotlib and seaborn:** For visualization.

***Results and Insights***

The project produces several customer segments based on their demographic and transactional data. These segments can help:

1. Personalize marketing strategies: By targeting specific segments with the right coupons or offers.

2. Increase customer retention: By identifying loyal customers (high burnt ratios) and giving them additional incentives.
   
3. Identify potential churn: By analyzing segments with low coupon usage or low engagement (low claimed ratios).
   
***Example Visualizations***

**Elbow Method:** Used to find the optimal number of clusters for KMeans.

**Scatter plot:** Visualizes customer segments based on coupon usage frequency and claimed ratio.

**Cluster Summary:** Provides the average behavior of customers in each cluster.
